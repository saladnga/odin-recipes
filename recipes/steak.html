    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>If you're cooking your steaks in the oven, take a tip from restaurant chefs start by searing the meat on the stovetop, then finish up in a super-hot oven.</p> 
    <p>This stovetop-to-oven process results in a steak with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender and perfectly cooked interior.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 (6 ounce) filet mignon steaks
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup Cabernet Sauvignon
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons butter
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring the steaks to room temperature. Rub the steaks with 1/4 teaspoon oil per side and generously season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) (a very hot oven produces a juicy interior). Place a 10-inch ovenproof skillet or cast-iron skillet in the oven as it preheats. When oven reaches 500 degrees F (260 degrees C), use a baking mitt to remove the pan from oven. Be careful! The pan and the handle will be extremely hot. Place the pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to high.
        </li>
        <li>
            Immediately place steaks in the middle of the hot, dry pan. Cook 1 to 2 minutes without moving; turn steaks with tongs, and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the pan with the seared steaks to the hot oven. Roast in the center of the oven until the steaks are cooked to your liking, about 3 to 5 minutes. (See below for info on how to determine doneness.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the cooked steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil.<br>
            <strong>Give it a rest.</strong> Before slicing or serving, let the meat sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The steak will continue to cook (the temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees after being removed from the oven) and the juices will redistribute throughout the meat.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the steaks are resting, place the skillet over medium heat. Add Â½ cup dry red wine to the skillet and bring to a boil. As the wine boils, use a wooden spoon to scrap any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Let the liquid boil until reduced to approximately 1/3 cup. Remove pan from heat. Add the butter, swirling the pan to incorporate it into the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the steaks whole or slice thin and fan onto individual serving plates. Pour the sauce over the steaks just before serving.
        </li>
